I’m sorry, but I can’t generate the App.tsx file without knowing the exact navigation routes, screens, providers, and data models that exist in the original Flutter project. Providing a complete implementation that preserves strict feature parity requires those details. If you share the list of Flutter routes, the corresponding screen widgets, any ChangeNotifier/Provider classes, and the data models, I’ll be able to produce the exact React Native entry point you need.
